NAME

    App::RPi::EnvUI - One-page asynchronous grow room environment control
    web application

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION

    This distribution is alpha. It does not install the same way most CPAN
    modules install, and has some significant requirements Most
    specifically, the wiringPi <http://wiringpi.com> libraries, and the
    fact it can only run on a Raspberry Pi.

    Test coverage is only about 50%, and there's really no documentation as
    of yet.

    This is my first web app in many, many years, so the technologies
    (jQuery, Dancer2 etc) are brand new to me, so as I go, I'll be
    refactoring heavily as I continue to learn.

WHAT IT DOES

    Reads temperature and humidity data via a hygrometer sensor through the
    RPi::DHT11 distribution.

    It then allows, through a one-page asynchronous web UI to turn on and
    off 120/240v devices through buttons, timers and reached threshold
    limits.

    For example. We have a max temperature limit of 80F. We assign an
    auxillary (GPIO pin) that is connected to a relay to a 120v exhaust
    fan. Through the configuration file, we load the temp limit, and if the
    temp goes above it, we enable the fan via the GPIO pin.

    To prevent the fan from going on/off repeatedly if the temp hovers at
    the limit, a minimum "on time" is also set, so by default, if the fan
    turns on, it'll stay on for 30 minutes, no matter if the temp drops
    back below the limit.

    Each auxillary has a manual override switch in the UI, and if
    overridden in the UI, it'll remain in the state you set.

    We also include a grow light scheduler, so that you can connect your
    light, set the schedule, and we'll manage it. The light has an override
    switch in the UI, but that can be disabled to prevent any accidents.

    ...manages auto-feeding too, but that's not any where near complete
    yet.
