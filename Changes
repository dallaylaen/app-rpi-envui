Changes history for App::RPi::EnvUI

0.04 NONREL
        - added sensor_pin to core config section in json and db
        - fix issue where wiringPi was being loaded multiple times, breaking
          things. First, set up a check in %INC to see if they've already
          been required, then instead of passing a new API object to each
          event, we now pass in $self instead, so we don't call new() which
          tries to load the wiringPi libraries again
        - the 'envui' app dir now gets placed in the user's home directory, and
          works

        - broke out the main components (route-handler, API, DB) into distinct
          abstraction layers making it easy to test specific sections, and use
          the various pieces external from the web app
        - significant amount of test coverage written, particularly for API
          and DB
        - many small bugs corrected, and error checking added while in the
          process of test writing
        - separated testing from prod in API and DB (needs more work)
        - initial work done on using memory-backed databases. For now, they are
          fully implemented in testing
        - temp and humidity limits are now grabbed by jquery from the API, so
          there's no risk of conflict (closes #1)
        - set reasonable real defaults in the default config file (closes #2)
        - we now get the control aux values from the API instead of having them
          specified all over the place manually (closes #3)
        - the "next on" UI display is now updated on each fetch of the aux
          states 9closes #8)
        - in the Makefile.PL in a postamble, we now create a new app dir
          (envui), and copy in the relevant pieces into it on 'make install'
          (closes #10). More work will be needed here
        - default config now has all aux pins set to -1. This is because GPIO 0
          is a valid pin
        - added core config section "testing" directive. This allows unit
          testing on non-Pi boards, and on machines that don't have the wiringPi
          C libraries installed
        - next release will be doc and test focused

0.02    2016-10-01
        - all auxillaries working
        - temp/humidity on/off limits working
        - aux override working
        - min on time working (temp/humidity)
        - light infrastructure added
        - feeding infrastructure added
        - initial pod for configuration
        - dist default config/db
        - graphs added, but don't use live data yet
        - added App::FatPacker build structure
